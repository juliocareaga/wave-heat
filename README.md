The numerical schemes (Implicit Euler, BDF2 and Newmark in time) are programmed in Python

The following Python packages are need: **mpi4py**, **numpy** and **scipy**. The main python codes are 3: **wave-heat-error.py** for the error computations, **wave-heat-example2.py** for the Westervelt example, and **wave-heat-example3.py** for the Kuznetsov example.

# **Error computations** 

Code **wave-heat-error.py** requires setting $\color{purple}\texttt{modeltype}$ which can assume the strings $\color{teal}\texttt{"W"}$ for the Westervelt model, and $\color{teal}\texttt{"K"}$ for the case of Kuznetsov's equation, $\color{purple}\texttt{timescheme}$ which defines the time approximation as $\color{teal}\texttt{"Euler"}$, $\color{teal}\texttt{"BDF2"}$ and $\color{teal}\texttt{"Newmark"}$. The sequence of space discretizations are set through the variable Ms (array), and the time steps divisions are accounted with Ns (array). The output corresponds to a '.mat' file, which contains the errors 

There are 3 scripts, one for each example:
