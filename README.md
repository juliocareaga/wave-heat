The numerical schemes (Implicit Euler, BDF2 and Newmark in time) are programmed in Python

The following Python packages are need: **mpi4py**, **numpy** and **scipy**. The main python codes are 3: **wave-heat-error.py** for the error computations, **wave-heat-example2.py** for the Westervelt example, and **wave-heat-example3.py** for the Kuznetsov example.

# **Error computations** 

Code **wave-heat-error.py** requires setting $\color{purple}\texttt{modeltype}$ as $\color{teal}\texttt{"W"}$ for the Westervelt model or $\color{teal}\texttt{"K"}$ for the case of Kuznetsov's equation, $\color{purple}\texttt{timescheme}$ which defines the time approximation $\color{teal}\texttt{"Euler"}$, $\color{teal}\texttt{"BDF2"}$ or $\color{teal}\texttt{"Newmark"}$, and the polynomial degree $\color{purple}\texttt{ell}$ (integer). Then run:
```console
python3 wave-heat-error.py
```
The sequence of space discretizations are set through the variable Ms (array), and the time steps divisions are accounted with Ns (array). The output corresponds to a $\texttt{\color{brown}mat}$ file, which contains vector of $L^2$-errors at the final times for each time step. After computing the errors for ($\color{purple}\texttt{modeltype}$, $\color{purple}\texttt{timescheme}$, $\color{purple}\texttt{ell}$) equals to

```console
("W", "Euler", 1), ("W", "BDF2", 2), ("W", "BDF2", 3)
("K", "Euler", 1), ("K", "BDF2", 2), ("K", "BDF2", 3)
```
The error plots can be obtained with **Matlab** or **Octabe** making use of **ploterror.m** changing the variable $\color{purple}\texttt{modeltype}$ as before. Note that this script requires the mat files produced with the input values explained above.

# Example 2

The main script is **wave-heat-example2.py**, and the simulation corresponds to the Westervelt equation with a manufactured initial pressure. The output corresponds to $\texttt{\color{brown}xdmf}$ and $\texttt{\color{brown}h5}$ files, which contain the pair of solutions (pressure and temperature) at the time points saved. The xdmf file can be loaded with **Paraview**, and the procedure to obtain the images is described next:



The required mesh is also contained in this repository and corresponds to **mesh-new.xdmf**. Note that the file **mesh-new.h5** is also needed.
